      <h1 id="about"> About me </h1>
        I am a Code Next member that tries their hardest and tries to comprehend everything, I like food that starts with the letter C. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Sign_language_C.svg/2000px-Sign_language_C.svg.png" width="24px">Because I'm weird like that, I also enjoy videogames but not scary ones, not because I can't handle them but because I want to be capable of sleeping peacefully. I have a lot of determination for everything I do, even though I like to play around a lot I still take opportunities serious.  <p>

      <h3 id="favmusic">  Favorite Music </h3>
        <p> I love music, that I have Spotify Premium which isn't cheap. But my favorite artist of all time is blackbear, reason why is because his music is unique to me and he actually takes his time in his music. But my favorite song isn't from him, but Hoodie Allen has a song that I love which is called "Surprise Party" that features blackbear. The beat is amazing, the lyrics all rhyme and their voices were good. 


        I also like Post Malone, my favorite song from him is "Psycho." I have other artists that have good songs that I like, examples are Hoodie Allen, Jeremy Zucker, Witt Lowry and more. Now here are my top 5 favorite songs: 1. Surprise Party (Hoodie Allen) 2. chateau (blackbear) 3. HURT (Witt Lowry) 4. miracles (Stalking Gia) 5. IDWK (DVBBS)  </p>
     

      <h4 id="travel"> Travel </h4>
        <p> The furthest I've ever traveled in my life is Mexico, specifically in Cuernavaca. It was a fun place to travel because it's a different environment, different people, food and a lot more! Although I'd still prefer to live in the US, the food there is amazing. </p>

      <h5 id="favshows"> Favorite Shows </h5>
        <p> My favorite show of all time is Riverdale because I like mystery stories. Not only because there are a lot of twists around it, but also the curiosity that fills up my body and I just <strong> love </strong> that feeling. </p>
